      - title: Estimates for pseudo-differential operators on the torus revisited. I
        content: |-
          Co-author: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/duvancardonas/home" target="_blank">Duván Cardona</a> <br> In this paper we prove \\(L^p\\)-estimates for Hörmander classes of pseudo-differential operators on the torus \\(\mathbb{T}^n\\). Our results are framed within the global symbolic calculus developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen on \\(\mathbb{T}^n \times \mathbb{Z}^n\\), by using the discrete Fourier analysis on the torus. This approach extends the classical \\((\rho, \delta)\\)-Hörmander classes to the toroidal setting. The main contributions of this work generalize the method of Álvarez and Hounie for \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\) to the torus, while also extending Fefferman's \\(L^p\\)-boundedness theorem to the toroidal context, even in cases where \\(\delta \geq \rho\\). When \\(\delta \leq \rho\\), our results align with and recover existing estimates found in the literature.
